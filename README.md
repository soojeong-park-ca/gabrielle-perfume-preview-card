## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Reflection

This is my first project using Tailwind CSS. I relied on the official Tailwind CSS Doc to build it. It was fascinating to not have to come up with a class name for each element. I was also able to use the tailwing config file to add customized class names with values I needed. I would love to use Tailwind CSS more on my next projects!

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) - Official Tailwind CSS Docs.
- [Web Dev Simplified on Learning Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksn1tThNTjI) - This video by Web Dev Simplified encouraged me to try Tailwind CSS just using my CSS knowledge and Tailwind CSS Docs.
